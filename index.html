    <h1>CS4641 Proposal - Team 8</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>The stock market is a well-known and studied financial market. Despite its complexity and unpredictability, it allows people to create retirement funds, pensions, and investment accounts to grow their wealth. While hedge funds dominate, our goal is to help everyday traders through machine learning algorithms that provide insight into trading popular stocks.</p>
    
        <h3>Literature Review:</h3>
        <p>Machine learning models, such as regression and neural networks, "have shown promising results in predicting stock market movements by analyzing historical data patterns" [2]. Similarly, "linear regression model demonstrated substantial accuracy in predicting financial stock market trends" [1]. Therefore, there is proven success regarding machine learning techniques in algorithmic trading.</p>

        <h3>Dataset Description:</h3>
        <p>We analyzed datasets from Kaggle, Yahoo Finance, and Bloomberg, with Yahoo Finance being the most popular. We decided to use the Kaggle "Stock Market Dataset," which offers more than two decades of information. This dataset includes daily data on date, opening price, closing price, lowest price, highest price, adjusted closing price, and trading volume. We focused on ten prevalent stocks: Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan, and Disney.</p>

        <h2>Problem/Motivation:</h2>
        <p>The problem is the difficulty of predicting financial markets. With financial institutions having more resources, we aim to use machine learning algorithms to help everyday traders compete.</p>

        <h2>Methods:</h2>

        <h3>Data preprocessing:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Normalization: Calculate means, standard deviations, open/closing prices.</li>
            <li>Principal Component Analysis: Use Singular Value Decomposition to define principal components.</li>
            <li>Cross Validation Sets: Split data into training and validation sets, comparing Kaggle and Yahoo Finance with Bloomberg data.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Models:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Linear Regression: Comparing variables.</li>
            <li>Support Vector Machine: Separating the data into categories.</li>
            <li>Neural Networks: Use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to find long-term dependencies.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>(Potential) Results and Discussion:</h2>

        <h3>Project Goals: </h3>
        <p>The objective is to predict whether a stock will have a higher closing price compared to its opening price on a given day (an uptick).</p>

        <h3>Labeling Predictions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>True Positive (TP): Model predicts an uptick. There is an uptick.</li>
            <li>True Negative (TN): Model predicts no uptick. There is no uptick.</li>
            <li>False Positive (FP): Model predicts an uptick. There is no uptick.</li>
            <li>False Negative (FN): Model predicts no uptick. There is an uptick.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Metrics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Accuracy: (TP + TN) / Total - Correctness</li>
            <li>Precision: TP / (TP + FP) - Quality</li>
            <li>Recall: TP / (TP + FN) - Completeness</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Expected Results:</h3>
        <p>The Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model is expected to have the most optimal predictions of the market due to its ability to capture the context of the data and address the gradient vanishing problem plaguing alternative variations. Our prediction is supported by past surveys indicating that "LSTM is the most preferred model among researchers for predicting stock price movements" [5]. In contrast, the Linear Regression model is expected to have the least accuracy since stock movements have a "non-linear, dynamic, and complex nature" [3] that cannot be robustly represented by a simple regression model. The SVM model is predicted to have reasonable accuracy but faces challenges related to the selection of kernel function parameters and the value in the loss-insensitive function.</p>
