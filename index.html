    <h1>CS4641 Proposal - Team 8</h1>
    <h2>Group members: Aayush, Gabriel, Mukund, Shubham, Tyler</h2>
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>The stock market is becoming one of the most well-known and studied financial markets of the modern day. Despite its complexity and unpredictability, it has allowed people to create retirement funds, pensions, and investment accounts amongst others that help grow their overall wealth. While hedge funds often dominate the financial world, our goal is to help the everyday trader through a machine learning assistant that provides insight when it comes to trading on the more popular stocks.</p>
    
        <h3>Literature Review:</h3>
        <p>Gabriel: Stock prices are often challenging to predict due to various factors such as the economy, a company's financial performance, and natural disasters. People can utilize techniques like neural networks and algorithms to help with the unpredictability. With data from places like Yahoo Finance and preprocessing the data, one can make successful machine learning algorithms to make accurate predictions.</p>
        <p>Aayush:  "The main purpose behind using this model in stock market prediction is that the predictions depend on large amounts of data and are generally dependent on the long term history of the market. So LSTM regulates error by giving an aid to the RNNs through retaining information for older stages, making the prediction more accurate" <p>
        <p>Shubham: LSTM, CNN, DT, ANN, and SVM are most promising models for stock prediction. Accuracy, RMSE, MAPE, MSE, and MAE are some popularly used metrics.</p>
        <p>Tyler:</p>
    
        <h3>Dataset Description:</h3>
        <p>We analyzed information from datasets in Kaggle, Yahoo Finance, and Bloomberg, with Yahoo Finance being the most popular dataset for financial data [4]. Through our analysis, we decided to use the Kaggle "Stock Market Dataset" which offers more than two decades of information on stocks and ETFs. The dataset includes the following content for each stock and ETF on a daily basis: date, opening price, closing price, lowest price, highest price, adjusted closing price, and trading volume.  To narrow the focus of our model, we analyze ten of the most prevalent and historic stocks: Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan, and Disney.</p>

        <h2>Problem/Motivation:</h2>
        <p>The problem we are trying to solve is the difficulty of predicting financial markets. With financial institutions having more resources at their disposal, we aim to use machine learning algorithms to help everyday traders achieve their financial goals.</p>

        <h2>Methods:</h2>

        <h3>Data preprocessing:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Normalization: We are going to find the means, standard deviations, open/closing prices of the stocks we have chosen.</li>
            <li>Principal Component Analysis: Use Singular value decomposition to define principal components within our datasets.</li>
            <li>Cross Validation Sets: Break up our components into training and validations sets by using Kaggle and Yahoo Finance to compare wih the Bloomberg data.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Models:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Linear Regression: Comparing variables.</li>
            <li>Support Vector Machine: Separating the data into different categories.</li>
            <li>Neural Networks: Use Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to find long term dependencies.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

        <h2>(Potential) Results and Discussion:</h2>

        <h3>Labeling Predictions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>True Positive (TP): Model predicts an uptick. There is an uptick.</li>
            <li>True Negative (TN): Model predicts no uptick. There is no uptick.</li>
            <li>False Positive (FP): Model predicts an uptick. There is no uptick.</li>
            <li>False Negative (FN): Model predicts no uptick. There is an uptick.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Metrics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Accuracy: (TP + TN) / Total - Correctness</li>
            <li>Precision: TP / (TP + FP) - Quality</li>
            <li>Recall: TP / (TP + FN) - Completeness</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Project Goals: </h3>
        <p>The objective of our model is to predict whether a stock will have a higher closing price compared to opening price on a given day, which we define as an uptick. </p>
        <h3>Expected Results:</h3>
        <p> The Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is expected to have the most optimal predictions of the market. This is because LSTM networks "capture the context of the data as they are being trained and can address the gradient vanishing problem, making them the idea approach for time series forecasting [4]." The Linear Regression model is expected to have the least accuracy in accordance to our metrics as stock movements have a "non linear, dynamic and complex nature [3]" which cannot be robustly represnted by a simple regression model. Our prediction is backed by several tests as past surveys on papers indicate "it is evident that LSTM is the most preferred model among researchers for predicting stock price movements [5]." The SVM model is predicted to have a reasonable accuracy, but has some drawbacks related to the "selection of the kernel function parameters [...] and the value in the loss insensitive function [3]". </p>
